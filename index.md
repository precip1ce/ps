Hi, I'm Patrick Shyu. Welcome to my personal homepage.

## About me
I'm a software engineer, entrepreneur, and content creator on YouTube. With 1+ million subscribers on YouTube, I create videos about tech, finance, and lifestyle. My style seeks to provide value through education and insights, while inspiring with entertainment and humor.

I began my coding journey in elementary school with QBasic and Visual Basic, making little games. I graduated from UC Berkeley with high honors, majoring in Computer Science (EECS), including a 1-year study abroad in Japan at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. Upon returning, I attended UC San Diego and received my Master's Degree in Computer Science (Computer Graphics), while also placing in the ACM programming competitions. During this time, I also worked internships at Microsoft, Juniper Networks, and Sun Microsystems. I also launched numerous pet projects to the university including social media sites, schedule organizers, and events websites used by thousands of students written primarily in Perl/CGI.

My first job was in 2007 at Sony Pictures in Los Angeles, working on 3D special effects for films coding in Python and C++. 

During this time, I built a series of Facebook games and apps that went viral to millions of users coded in PHP, MySQL, and Javascript. I quit my job, booked a flight to London, and went full-time on side projects reaching 2 million users while working out of Starbucks cafes and Apple stores for WiFi. Within 2 years of self-employment, I had become a millionaire. I built a total of 50 apps or so, including some that would scale to millions of users supported on 10 web & database servers that I manually sharded and managed.

After the Facebook era faded, I grew bored and returned to the office working at small social gaming startups, including Groupon where I coded in Ruby on Rails.

By 2013, I was still bored and quit my job, and relocated to New York to pursue my own projects. Living in a luxurious apartment like an ivory tower, I realized how isolating luxury is and began what would become a long journey into minimalism, embracing experiences over materialism. I traveled through Europe staying in cheap hostels through the Swiss Alps, the French coast, and Southern Spain. I developed an interest in DSLR photography and timelapse videos. My travels take me back to Japan too, and I develop a popular timelapse/photography desktop software achieving 500K user sessions written in Adobe AIR.

By 2014, I converted my old Facebook web games into iPhone games, teaching myself iOS development. I launched about 9 apps to the App Store to 150k+ downloads.

By September 2014, I joined Google as an iOS software engineer for the YouTube app coding primarily in iOS and some Python. I'm eventually promoted to the Tech Lead of App Architecture for the YouTube iOS app, helping the app achieve rank #1 in the Apple App Store with 150+ million users.

In 2018, I launched my YouTube channel for fun, pioneering the tech influencer space and teaching coding with a blend of insight and comedy. 

In May 2018, I join Meta as a staff software engineer for the Facebook Video team working in iOS and PHP. I joined Instagram briefly coding in Python, before conflicts of interest arose with my YouTube channel. I returned to my entrepreneurial endeavors.

Since, I went fulltime on YouTube. Just talking at my desk, the TechLead YouTube channel has achieved 150+ million views worldwide. I launched a variety of products, including [Tech Interview Pro](https://techinterviewpro.com/) that has helped many people pass the FAANG interviews to work in tech.

## Hobbies
I enjoy playing with my dog, traveling, gaming, photography, sailing, sci-fi, coffee, and learning.
