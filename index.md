Hi, I'm Patrick Shyu. Welcome to my personal homepage.

## About me
I'm a software engineer, entrepreneur, and content creator. With 1+ million subscribers on YouTube, I create videos about tech, finance, and lifestyle. I seek to provide value through education and insight, while inspiring with entertainment and humor.

I began my coding journey in elementary school with QBasic and Visual Basic, building little games. I graduated from UC Berkeley with high honors, majoring in Computer Science (EECS), including a 1-year study abroad in Japan at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. Upon returning, I attended UC San Diego and received my Master's Degree in Computer Science (Computer Graphics), while also placing in the ACM programming competitions. During this time, I also worked internships at Microsoft, Juniper Networks, and Sun Microsystems. I launched numerous pet projects to the university students including social media apps, schedule organizers, and events websites used by thousands of students coded primarily in Perl/CGI.

My first job was at Sony Pictures in Los Angeles in 2007, working on 3D special effects for films coding in C++ and Python. In restrospect, despite entry-level pay, this was one of my best jobs.

During this time, I independently built a series of Facebook games and apps that went viral to millions of users as I taught myself PHP, MySQL, and Javascript. I quit my job, spontaneously booked a flight to London, and went full-time on my side projects reaching 2 million users while working out of Starbucks cafes and Apple stores for WiFi. Within 2 years of self-employment, I had become a millionaire. I built around 50 web apps, including some that would reach millions of users supported across 10 web & database servers that I manually scaled and sharded.

Having achieved financial success early, I realized it would be a waste if I were to save it all for old-age retirement. I wanted to maximize the combination of what I had: health, wealth, time, and vitality. My philosophy on lifestyle would begin here.

After the Facebook apps era faded, I grew bored and returned to the office working at various startups, including Groupon where I coded in Ruby on Rails.

By 2013, I grew bored again and quit my job, relocating to New York to pursue my own projects and teach myself investing and trading. I needed to learn finance. However living in a luxurious apartment as if in an ivory tower, I realized how isolating luxury can be and left to begin what would become a journey into minimalism, embracing experiences over materialism. I traveled through Europe staying in cheap hostels on a journey through the Swiss Alps, the French Riviera, and Southern Spain. I developed an interest in DSLR photography and timelapse videos and started my first YouTube channel [Blue Eden](https://www.youtube.com/blueedenhd), a landscape travel channel with 1.5m views. My travels take me across the world and eventually back to Japan, where in my spare time I develop a popular timelapse/photography desktop software gaining 500K user sessions coded in Adobe AIR.

By 2014, I converted my old Facebook web games into iPhone games, teaching myself iOS app development. I launched about 9 apps to the App Store to 150k+ downloads.

By September 2014, I joined Google as an iOS software engineer for the YouTube app, coding primarily in Objective-C and Python. I'm eventually promoted to the Tech Lead of App Architecture, helping the YouTube iOS app achieve rank #1 in the Apple App Store with 150+ million users.

By 2018, I launched the TechLead YouTube channel for fun, pioneering the tech influencer space and teaching coding with a blend of insights and comedy.

By May 2018, I join Meta as a staff software engineer for the Facebook Video team developing in iOS and PHP. I joined Instagram briefly coding in Python, before a conflict of interest arose with my YouTube channel. I returned to my entrepreneurial endeavors.

Afterwards, I finally went fulltime on YouTube. The TechLead YouTube channel has achieved 150+ million views worldwide and has partnered with numerous sponsors and brands. I've also launched a variety of my own projects, including [Tech Interview Pro](https://techinterviewpro.com/) interview training that has helped many software engineers land tech jobs.

I remain a student of life and continue to explore the frontiers.
