Hi, I'm Patrick Shyu. Welcome to my personal homepage.

## About
I'm a software engineer, entrepreneur, and content creator. With 1+ million subscribers on YouTube, I create videos about tech, finance, and lifestyle. I seek to share education and insights, while inspiring with entertainment and humor.

I began my coding journey in elementary school with QBasic and Visual Basic, building small games. Graduating from UC Berkeley with high honors, I majored in Computer Science (EECS) including a 1-year study abroad program in Japan at the Tokyo Institute of Technology that would be life-changing. Upon returning, I attended UC San Diego for my Master's Degree in Computer Science (Computer Graphics), while also placing in the ACM programming competitions. I also worked internships at Microsoft, Juniper Networks, and Sun Microsystems. During this time, I also launched numerous pet projects to university students such as social media apps, schedule organizers, and event websites that would be used by thousands of students coded primarily in self-taught Perl/CGI.

After university, my first job was at Sony Pictures in Los Angeles in 2007, working on 3D special effects for films where I coded in C++ and Python. In restrospect, despite entry-level pay, this was one of the best jobs throughout my career.

During this time, I independently built a series of Facebook web games and social apps that went viral to millions of users as I taught myself PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript. I quit my job, spontaneously booked a flight to London, and went full-time on my side projects reaching 2 million users while working out of Starbucks cafes and Apple stores for WiFi. Within a year, I had become a millionaire. I built around 50 apps in total, including some that would reach millions of users on 10 web servers & databases that I manually scaled and sharded. Modern autoscaling technologies weren't available at the time, so servers would crash under load in the middle of the night.

Having achieved financial success early, I realized it would be a waste if I were to save it all for a standard old-age retirement. I wanted to maximize the combination of 4 factors I identified I had: health, wealth, time, and vitality. My interest in travel and lifestyle design would begin here.

After the Facebook apps era faded, I grew bored and eventually returned to the office working at various startup jobs, including Groupon where I coded in Ruby on Rails.

By 2013, I grew bored yet again and quit my job, relocating to New York to teach myself investing and trading. I needed to learn finance. However, living in a luxurious apartment like in an ivory tower, I realized how isolating luxury can be and left to begin what would become a journey into minimalism, embracing experiences over materialism. I traveled through Europe staying in hostels on a month-long journey through the Swiss Alps, the French Riviera, and Southern Spain. I became interested in DSLR photography and timelapse videos, starting my first YouTube channel [Blue Eden](https://www.youtube.com/blueedenhd), a travel photography channel with 1.5m views. This was lot at the time, gaining sailboat sponsorships and featured in popular blogs. My travels eventually took me back to Japan, where in my spare time I develop a popular timelapse/photography desktop software gaining 500k user sessions coded in Adobe AIR.

By 2014, I ported my old Facebook web games to the newly announced iPhone, teaching myself iOS app development. I launched about 9 apps to the App Store to 150k+ downloads.

By September 2014, I joined Google as an iOS software engineer in the YouTube team, coding primarily in Objective-C and Python. I was eventually promoted to the Tech Lead of App Architecture, helping the YouTube iOS app achieve rank #1 in the Apple App Store with 150+ million users.

By 2018, I launched the TechLead YouTube channel for fun, pioneering the tech influencer space and teaching coding with a blend of insights and comedy.

By May 2018, I joined Meta as a staff software engineer in the Facebook Video team developing in iOS and PHP. I joined Instagram Ads briefly coding in Python, before a conflict of interest arose with my YouTube channel. I returned to my entrepreneurial endeavors.

By 2019, I finally went fulltime on YouTube. The TechLead YouTube channel covers tech, finance, and lifestyle and has achieved 150+ million views worldwide and has partnered with numerous sponsors and brands. I've also created additional projects, including [Tech Interview Pro](https://techinterviewpro.com/) interview training that has helped many software engineers land tech jobs.

Today, I remain a student of life and continue to explore the frontiers.
